The best account on twitter is [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates). This
account offers a fundamentally important service by providing expert rating of
dogs. In this blog post I am going to examine their tweets and try to make sure
that all dogs are appreciated appropriately by followers of the account. This is
important, by using some statistical techniques (for the purposes of being fancy
I could choose to call linear regression: *machine learning*) I will check that
the number of likes and retweets a dog gets isn't influenced by the rating
chosen by [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) because after all: [*they
are good dogs Brunt*](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/they're-good-dogs-brent).

Here is an example of one of their tweets:

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is
Armas. He is king of the frosty head tilts. Flawlessly executed sneaky tongue
slip as well. 13/10 simply breathtaking <a
href="https://t.co/ysuI48Co7A">pic.twitter.com/ysuI48Co7A</a></p>&mdash;
WeRateDogsâ„¢ (@dog_rates) <a
href="https://twitter.com/dog_rates/status/975887646223462400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March
20, 2018</a></blockquote>
<script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js"
charset="utf-8"></script>

I'm sure you would agree: Armas is a **very** good dog and he has gotten a high
number of likes and retweets but is **13/10** influencing that? Is **13** indeed
the *correct* score? Would a more accurate score (perhaps 12? perhaps 14?) have
made him get more likes and retweets (the "cuddles" of the twitter world)?

**I in no way intend to offer any doubt as to the expertise of
[@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) but I will analyse things and
hopefully confirm that they're doing an excellent job.**

(Spoiler: don't worry all the dogs are rated h\*ckin well.)

There are essentially 2 steps to this analysis:

- Collecting the data;
- Carrying out a number of statistical measuring techniques.

I will do all of this using the [python](https://www.python.org) programming
language which is one of the most popular programming tools for scientific
research. (Important scientific research like evaluating
[@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates).

If you would like the source code for the analysis you can find it here:
[https://github.com/drvinceknight/DataScienceingDogRates](github.com/drvinceknight/DataScienceingDogRates)

## The data

The raw data looks something like:

```python
               created_at                                          full_text  like_count  retweet_count

3215  2017-02-20 17:10:07                      @thatswattsup @jk_rowling yes         504              7
```

Using a bit of [regular
expressions]("https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression") I also get:

- `score`: the score given to the doggo;
- `scale`: the scale for the score (usually 10);
- `full_text_len`: how long the tweet was.

As you can see in the sample of data there, I am collecting the replies and
various other pieces of data **but** for my work I need to only include **true**
ratings of doggos. So I reject any tweet that doesn't follow these rules:

- The `score` is between 0 and 20;
- The `scale` is 10;
- The full text of the tweet doesn't start with a `RT` or a `@`.

**Now we are ready to analyse things**

## The relationship between likes and retweets

Let us start by looking at the relationship between likes and retweets of each
tweet.

Here is a plot showing the relationship between the `log` of these two counts:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drvinceknight/DataScienceingDogRates/master/img/log_retweets_v_log_likes.png)

That looks like a pretty linear relationship and indeed if we fit a linear
regression model to this we obtain an \\(R^2\\) value of \\(0.817\\) with a
\\(p\\)value less than \\(10^{-3}\\). This implies that there's a pretty good
relationship between the number of retweets (\\(X\\)) and likes (\\(Y\\)) on a
given tweet:

$$\log(Y)\approx a\log(X) + b$$

which can be simplified to give:

$$Y = e ^ {a\log(x) + b}$$

Here is this specific relationship:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drvinceknight/DataScienceingDogRates/master/img/retweets_v_likes.png)

This will allow us to mainly concentrate on likes for the rest of our analysis.
(We could have just as arbitrarily chosen retweets.)

## How do likes change over time

If we take a look at the number of likes of each tweet over time we see that
there is an increasing trend:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drvinceknight/DataScienceingDogRates/master/img/likes_v_time.png)

I suspect that this is linked to the growth in followers (and potentially users
of twitter) over time.

To correct for this we'll fit a trend line to our data:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drvinceknight/DataScienceingDogRates/master/img/likes_v_time_with_trend.png)

Once we have done that we will now only consider the *detrended* number of
likes, ie the difference of the number of likes the tweet got with the trend.
So, if a tweet has a positive detrended count that implies the doggo got more
than expected.

So we can, for example take a look at how the time of the day affects things:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drvinceknight/DataScienceingDogRates/master/img/likes_v_hour.png)

We see that doggos posted at 5am GMT seem to get the most likes.

Also, it's not great to be a doggo posted on a Friday apparently (poor doggos):

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drvinceknight/DataScienceingDogRates/master/img/likes_v_day.png)

This is only slightly insightful, there will always be better and/or worse times
of the day to post things.

**What I really want to know is: does the work done by
[@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) (writing the tweet and scoring the
doggos) advantage some doggos over others in terms of the likes they receive?**

## The effect of score

Looking at the number of doggos given each rating we see that \\(15/10\\) is
very rare and that most doggos are a \\(13/10\\).

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drvinceknight/DataScienceingDogRates/master/img/count_v_score.png)

Let us see how this affects the likes:

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/drvinceknight/DataScienceingDogRates/master/img/likes_v_score.png)

That plot shows the variation of the number of (detrended) likes for each group
of scores. The small horizontal line shows an average (the median). It's clear
that **15/10** gets a higher average than all other doggos (they are probably
very very good doggos) but what about the range from **11/10** to **14/10**?

If we just consider those ratings and perform a statistical test called analysis
of variance or
[ANOVA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Analysis_of_variance) we actually
**THANKFULLY** see that there is no (statistically significant)
difference between how liked the doggos are based on their score.

There is other analysis that could be carried out but frankly **I feel
embarrassed for doubting the expertise of
[@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates)**: they are a professional high
quality dog rating service and I should have known that any analysis of the
data would only confirm this.

## Summary

This involved a few things:

- Grabbing the tweets using the [Tweepy](http://www.tweepy.org) library.
- Cleaning and extracting further data using the
  [Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/) library.
- Analysing things using statistical methods and visualisation:
  - [statsmodels](https://www.statsmodels.org/stable/index.html)
  - [sklearn](http://scikit-learn.org)
  - [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org)
  - even some [sympy](http://www.sympy.org/en/index.html) to solve an equation.

## PS

If by any weird way [@dog_rates](https://twitter.com/dog_rates) happens to read
this, I would not have been able to do this without Riggins, he's a very good
dog and helped tremendously. (Always tries his best.)
